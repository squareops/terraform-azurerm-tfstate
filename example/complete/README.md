## Security, Validation and pull-requests
we have offered here high standard, quality code. Hence we are using several [pre-commit hooks](.pre-commit-config.yaml) and [GitHub Actions](https://gitlab.com/sq-ia/aws/eks/-/tree/v1.0.0#security-validation-and-pull-requests) as a workflow. So here we will create pull-requests to any branch and validate the request automatically using pre-commit tool.

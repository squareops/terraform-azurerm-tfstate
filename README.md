<br>
Terraform module to create Remote State Storage resources for workload deployment on Azure Cloud.

## Usage Example

```hcl
module "backend" {
  source                    = "squareops/tfstate-asc/azurerm"
  resource_group_name       = "skaf"
  storage_account_name      = "skafaccount"
  storage_container_name    = "tfstate" # unique storage container name
  resource_group_location   = "eastus"
  environment               = "prod"
}
```
Refer [examples](https://github.com/squareops/terraform-azurerm-tfstate-asc/tree/main/examples/complete) for more details.

## Permissions
The required permissions to create resources from this module can be found [here](https://github.com/squareops/terraform-azurerm-tfstate-asc/tree/main/roles.md)

## Important Note
Terraform state locking is a mechanism used to prevent multiple users from simultaneously making changes to the same Terraform state, which could result in conflicts and data loss. A state lock is acquired and maintained by Terraform while it is making changes to the state, and other instances of Terraform are unable to make changes until the lock is released.

By using Azure Blob Storage as the backend for storing the tfstate file, Terraform automatically benefits from the built-in locking mechanism provided by Azure. This ensures the safety and consistency of your infrastructure state when working in a team or executing multiple Terraform operations simultaneously.
